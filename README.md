## ***Backstory***

My parents were attendees of Dixie College back in the 90s. They took SUU classes there via sattelite, and my father later did his masters at the main campus here in Cedar. A few years after I was born, he found work in Vegas. 

I lived there throughout most of my childhood, and my academic talents allowed me to attend a magnet program in middle school. There, my under-par social skills led to friction with some of my classmates. For whatever reason, those most averse to me happened to be the ones interested in coding. They would show each other the programs they had made and teach each other tricks, but if I were to approach them with curiosity, I would be shooed away.

I say this not to make myself a victim, or to act vindictively towards these former twelve-year-olds. I had a variety of good and bad experiences during that time, and I likely brought much of this particular pain on myself. Nevertheless, throughout much of my life, any advanced coding felt like something I "shouldn't" do, and my rejection by my classmates is likely a factor in that.

During high school, my father lent me the TI-83 calculator he had used during his college term. While bored in class, I messed around with the programmability of the device to make some basic scripts of my own. But I never researched anything more advanced. Part of this is likely due to the prior-mentioned issues, but my own lack of motivation or organization affected me in that regard as much as it did in my general life.

Between my sophomore and junior years of high school, my father found new work in the Houston area. We moved there, and two years later I graduated with an almost minimal GPA. It wasn't that I struggled with the material itself, but rather that I couldn't be bothered to do homework or projects. This general laziness continued into my adult life.

I spent over a year unemployed. I tried an online college, but flunked out after only a few months due to my own inability to engage with the content. It was a depressing existence, yet I couldn't find the courage to change my habits. Eventually, my parents sought to teach me a lesson about my future prospects without any education or vocational training, and I found myself compelled to a job as a landscape worker.

It was rough work, as one might expect. And while I learned many things on that job, ironically, I was content to do it. It was laborious physically, yes, but mentally it was no challenge to do a relatively simple task under supervision. Even though the job stuck me in a different type of rut, it at least gave me a basic sense of purpose. This helped my mood and helped me feel like I had at least some choice in my life.

After over a year of that job, I quit and tried online school again. Though it went better than the previous attempt, I still found myself slipping into habits of disengagement. However, I still found enough motivation to improve myself in other ways. I finally got a drivers license, I learned Excel, I started going to the gym regularly. And though I still suffered from depressive episodes, I was at last progressing.

The slowly-rising trend of my life continued through the next couple of years, and eventually I found myself with both a day job as a substitue teacher and a weekend job doing data entry, alongside various personal and social commitments. Thought I was much happier, I didn't think of it as a long-term situtation. I was both enjoying my current life and, at the same time, felt ready to move on to the next stage of it.

So it came to be that I moved here to Cedar, to room with my brother. I didn't have a solid plan, except to find one. Full-time work was considered, as was enrolling at SUU after some time. It was only by chance that I learned about this program at Southwest Tech, but since enrollment happened to start the next week, I took it as a sign that I should give it a try.

So that's why I'm here. Like with my decision to move out to Cedar, I have a broader range of outcomes in mind than some might argue I should. But I know that as long as I have a purpose and support, I can continue progressing until the I find the right opportunity.

Here's to that.
